   <p>Product Data Engineering refers to the life cycle management of digital product data.  Digital product data is generated by various Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) and delivered to the government. </p>

<p>
Digital product data can have different representation depending on the function it is intended to fulfill.  Examples include fully annotated engineering drawings and three dimensional geometric models that contain the as-designed and as-fielded configuration of weapon systems.  Digital product data can also include numerous technical manuals that guide and govern all maintenance and repair work on the weapon systems.
</p> 

<p>
  Some of the product data engineering functions we routinely perform are listed below:

</p>

<p><strong>Acceptance</strong> (verification and validation) of digital product data.  This involves an assessment of digital product data delivered to the government to ensure completeness and compliancy with contractually mandated digital data standards.  We use a collection of rules driven intelligent software tools to perform this service.</p>

<p><strong>Conversion</strong> of digital product data.  This involves one-time re-representation of the structure and syntax of digital product data.  One example includes conversion of technical manuals from native publishing formats to standards compliant SGML or from SGML to S1000d.  Another example is the conversion from one native CAD to another native CAD or 3-D PDF, JT, IGES or other standards compliant formats.</p>

<p><strong>Cleansing</strong> of digital product data.  This involves one-time improvement of the currency and accuracy of legacy product data.  We have successfully undertaken multiple data cleansing efforts (lite cleanup and heavy cleanup) of USAF legacy product data in the last decade.</p>

<p><strong>Sustainment</strong> of digital product data.  This involves the application ongoing (continuous) changes to digital product data to reflect the realities of operation, maintenance and repair in the field.  We have competed, won and performed on multiple data sustainment tasks since our founding.</p>

<p><strong>Normalization</strong> of digital product data.  This involves the application of referential integrity as well as taxonomy to digital product data when and where applicable.  Performing this task requires subject matter expertise in how digital data is created, organized and used across multiple functions.</p>


<p><strong>Migration</strong> of digital product data.  We are often tasked with migrating large volumes of digital product data from one Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solution platform to another.  Digital product data is extracted from the old PLM platform, necessary transformations applied and then loaded into the new PLM platform.  We have successfully undertaken multiple data migration tasks over the last 10 years.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation</strong>of Custom and Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software applications across a large enterprise</p>
